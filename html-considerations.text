General HTML performance considerations

The first request for a web page is for an HTML resource—and ensuring 
that HTML arrives quickly with minimal delays is a key performance goal.

When you enter a URL in the browser's address bar, the browser sends a 
GET request to the server to retrieve it. The first request for a web page 
is for an HTML resource.

That initial request for HTML goes through several steps, each of which take 
some time. Reducing the time spent on each step gives you a faster Time to 
First Byte (TTFB). 

a high TTFB does make it challenging to reach the designated "good" thresholds 
for metrics such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Contentful Paint (FCP).

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
Based on discussions in the W3C Web Performance Working Group and research done at 
Google, we've found that a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a 
page is loaded is to look at when the largest element is rendered.

LCP reports the render time of the largest image, text block, or video visible in 
the viewport, relative to when the user first navigated to the page.

To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have Largest Contentful
 Paint of 2.5 seconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your 
 users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented 
 across mobile and desktop devices.

First Contentful Paint (FCP)?
First Contentful Paint (FCP) measures the time from when the user first navigated to 
the page to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. For this 
metric, "content" refers to text, images (including background images), <svg> elements, 
or non-white <canvas> elements.

 It is important to note that FCP includes any unload time from the previous page,
 connection set up time, redirect time, and Time To First Byte (TTFB) which can be 
 significant when measured in the field and can lead to differences between field 
 and lab measurements.

 To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Contentful 
 Paint of 1.8 seconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your 
 users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented 
 across mobile and desktop devices.

MINIMIZE REDIRECTS
When a resource is requested, the server may respond with a redirect, either with 
a permanent redirect (a 301 Moved Permanently response) or a temporary one (a 302 
Found response).

 Redirects slow down page load speed because it requires the browser to make an 
 additional HTTP request at the new location to retrieve the resource. There are two
 types of redirects:

 Same-origin redirects that occur entirely within your origin. These types of redirects 
 are completely within your control, as the logic for managing them resides entirely on 
 your web server.
 Cross-origin redirects that are initiated by another origin. These types of redirects are 
 typically out of your control.
 Cross-origin redirects are often used by ads, URL-shortening services, and other third 
 party services. Though cross-origin redirects are outside of your control, you may still 
 want to check that you avoid multiple redirects—for example, having an ad that links to 
 an HTTP page which in turn redirects to its HTTPS equivalent, or a cross-origin redirect 
 that arrives to your origin, but then triggers a same-origin redirect.

CACHE HTML RESPONSES
Why Cache HTML?
Caching an HTML page (saving a version of it so it loads faster next time) can reduce the 
load on the server and improve speed for users. When a page is cached, users can access it 
quicker because it’s not downloaded fresh from the server every single time they visit.

The Challenge with HTML Caching
HTML pages often link to other resources like CSS, JavaScript, and images. These resources 
are sometimes named in ways that change when the content is updated (like adding a “fingerprint” 
in the filename). So if the HTML page is cached but one of these resources is updated, the cached 
page may still point to the old, outdated version.

The Solution: Short Cache Lifetime
One approach is to set a short cache time for HTML, like five minutes. This way:

CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) and browsers can still cache the page briefly, reducing the number 
of requests to your server.
Updates to the HTML (like after a new deployment) will be picked up within a few minutes.
This short caching is useful when the content is “static,” meaning it doesn’t change often or doesn’t 
need to be personalized.

When Not to Cache HTML
For pages that change based on who’s logged in (like a user’s dashboard), caching can be a problem:

Security issues may arise, especially if private info is cached and then shown to the wrong user.
Freshness issues mean the user might see outdated content if the cache doesn’t update.
For these cases, it’s usually best to avoid caching HTML at all.

Using ETag and Last-Modified for Smart Caching
If you do decide to cache HTML, you can use “validation headers” like ETag or Last-Modified to make 
sure the cache stays fresh.

ETag: This is a unique ID for each version of a resource. If the HTML changes, the ETag also changes. 
When a browser asks for the page, it sends back the current ETag. If the server’s ETag matches the browser’s, 
it just says “Not Modified” (a quick response) and uses the cached version.
Last-Modified: This is a timestamp of when the HTML was last updated. The browser checks this timestamp with 
the server before using the cached version.
The Downside
Using ETag or Last-Modified is helpful but still involves a small delay to check freshness. It’s a compromise: 
you get faster loads with a cache but still need some checks to keep content updated.

Bottom line: Caching HTML can be tricky, so it’s a balance between speed and freshness. For pages that rarely change, 
a short cache time is fine. For personalized content, avoid caching HTML.
