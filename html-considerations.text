General HTML performance considerations

The first request for a web page is for an HTML resourceâ€”and ensuring 
that HTML arrives quickly with minimal delays is a key performance goal.

When you enter a URL in the browser's address bar, the browser sends a 
GET request to the server to retrieve it. The first request for a web page 
is for an HTML resource.

That initial request for HTML goes through several steps, each of which take 
some time. Reducing the time spent on each step gives you a faster Time to 
First Byte (TTFB). 

a high TTFB does make it challenging to reach the designated "good" thresholds 
for metrics such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Contentful Paint (FCP).

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
Based on discussions in the W3C Web Performance Working Group and research done at 
Google, we've found that a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a 
page is loaded is to look at when the largest element is rendered.

LCP reports the render time of the largest image, text block, or video visible in 
the viewport, relative to when the user first navigated to the page.

To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have Largest Contentful
 Paint of 2.5 seconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your 
 users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented 
 across mobile and desktop devices.

First Contentful Paint (FCP)?
First Contentful Paint (FCP) measures the time from when the user first navigated to 
the page to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. For this 
metric, "content" refers to text, images (including background images), <svg> elements, 
or non-white <canvas> elements.

 It is important to note that FCP includes any unload time from the previous page,
  connection set up time, redirect time, and Time To First Byte (TTFB) which can be 
  significant when measured in the field and can lead to differences between field 
  and lab measurements.

  To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Contentful 
  Paint of 1.8 seconds or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your 
  users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented 
  across mobile and desktop devices.
